# Italiancpp community "Big event template".
Derived from the [Event theme](https://github.com/melvinchng/event-jekyll-theme).

Still a work in progress with too many elements from the original theme that we do not use.

This template is to be used as a "one off" for each of the community big events.
We assume to customize it every time. After all, every event will require some tweaks.
This way we can keep some "garbage" out of the main community site.
