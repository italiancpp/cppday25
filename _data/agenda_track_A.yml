  item: "Zero or More: A Tour Through C++ Techniques for Returning Multiple Values"
  speaker: 
    - Alberto Barbati
  abstract: "From raw buffers to generators, the journey of returning an arbitrary number of elements in C++ reflects the evolution of the language itself. C++98 relied on C-style pre-allocated buffers, though output iterators provided an alternative. C++11 made returning containers efficient with move semantics, and lambdas introduced allocation-free flexibility. Then came C++20 with `span` and ranges, unlocking composability — and now C++23 introduces generators, making it all feel effortless.<br/>Each technique has trade-offs (yes, even buffers have their place!). This talk walks through the strengths, pitfalls, and use cases for each approach — because knowing <strong>all</strong> the tools in your toolbox makes you a better programmer."
